# Reester-css-project

**Reester** is a simple web page created using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project focuses on practicing **CSS layout, display, colors, and styling**.

The page includes:  
- **Product Cards Section** ‚Äì Four cards with images, titles, descriptions, and buttons arranged in a clean grid layout.  
- **Contact Form** ‚Äì A form at the bottom for users to enter their name, age, and email, styled using CSS for a neat and responsive design.
